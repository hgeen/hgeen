Hi, I'm Seb  <br/>

I'm currently learning C#, C/C++, and a little bit of Lua.  <br/>
I plan on learning Zig, Rust, and maybe V in the distant future. <br/>

I enjoy game development, low level programming, and embedded programming. <br/>
I somewhat frequently make tools for school to assist me with my journey to college. <br/>

Feel free to check out my projects! <br/>
